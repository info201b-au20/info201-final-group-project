# Final Project

## Domain of interest

**Main field/domain:**
How different age groups use social media.

**Why are you interested in this field/domain:**
It is personal to us, it is how we communicate to people consistently.
Social media is something that us as a society uses everyday, regardless of
their age. We are intrigued by the differences in how people use social media
depending on their age because we know first hand experience the differences
in the way we use social media compared to our parents.
